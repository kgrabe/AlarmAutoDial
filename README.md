House alarm panel outputs are connected to an ARDUINO GSM SHIELD 2 (ANTENNA CONNECTOR).

The alarm panel's outputs have the following open collector outputs:
  Alarm Set
  Panic Attack
  Alarm Activated (bell ringing)
  
Any change to any of the alarm outputs initiates an SMS being sent to the number in the file phoneNumbers.h
